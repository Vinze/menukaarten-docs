<h2>Version History</h2>
<p>In this piece of the document the different builds of our framework are documented and the differences between the versions are explained.</p>
<br />
<h3>Version 0.1:</h3>
<strong>Framework:</strong> Kohana<br />
<p>The first version created was build on the Kohana Framework. Kohana is a fork of the Codeigniter Framework. Because of experience with this framework it was chosen for the first built of the application.</p>

<br />
<h3>Version 0.2:</h3>
<strong>Framework:</strong> SexyFramework<br />

<p>From this version Kohana was removed and SexyFramework was born. After some discussion there was decided that because of learning purposes an own framework should be made. Other reasons were that existing frameworks are quite bloated and contain many files and functions that arenâ€™t used. The goal was to create a framework that could be used outside of this project and was as small as possible.<p>

<p>The first version was build when the application reached version 0.2, so the version of the framework is the same as the application minus one. The naming of the folders was more like a summary of the files it contained. The Lib folder contained the most important files, which contained the classes that were extended by basically all the other files, like the config-file, base controller and model and a database-file. The routes were also described in a file in this folder.<p>
