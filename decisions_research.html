<h1>Decisions &amp; research</h1>
<p>In this part of the documentation you will find the decisions that where made about a specific set of features of the framework. The most important thing that was kept in mind while making the decisions, was experience, usability and how other frameworks fixed those problems. It is also good to show you what the other options were that were researched.</p>
<p>When a problem occurred or a decision needed to be made, a short research was done to see what other frameworks did, if there was a design pattern for this type of problem. After that the options were discussed and sometimes a consult was planned to get another opinion. After all the information was gathered, a decision was made and documented.</p>
<p>Because of the fact that SexyFramework was built during a project for school, this section is specifically for the teachers, so they can see how the choices that were made are justified.</p>
