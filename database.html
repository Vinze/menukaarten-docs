<h1>Database design</h1>
<p>During all the phases of the project the database changed a lot. The least amount of tables was 5, the largest amount 9. Some had foreign keys, others did not. In this section the differences and choices that were made are found.</p>

<h3>Version 0.1</h3>
<img src="assets/images/menuk1.png" />
<p>What mattered in the first version was that there was at least something to show, because there was not a lot of time left. Therefore a structure was made up that did not allow any levels. A customer would make a menucard, after which the categories could be made. These categories were linked with a menucard. Then the customer was able to make subcategories and link them to categories. After all the previous steps were completed, the system allowed the customer to make products and link them to a subcategory. This was a very closed and limited system, but it worked.</p>

<h3>Version 0.2</h3>
<img src="assets/images/menuk2.png" />
