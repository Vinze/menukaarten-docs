<h1>Version History</h1>
<p>In this piece of the document the different builds of our framework are documented and the differences between the versions are explained.</p>

<h2>Version 0.1:</h2>
<span class="bold">Framework:</span> Kohana<br />
<p>The first version created was build on the Kohana framework. Kohana is a fork of the Codeigniter Framework. Because of experience with this framework it was chosen for the first built of the application.</p>
<p>Apparently, Kohana was bloated and had so many unused files for the project, that the decision was made to create a new framework. That is were SexyFramework was born. Then why is version 0.1 still in this version history? Because it was the start of SexyFramework. Some design patterns were copied from Kohana, some from other frameworks and others where created out of experience.</p>

<h2>Version 0.2:</h2>
<span class="bold">Framework:</span> SexyFramework<br />
<p>The first version is version 0.2. The idea that arose during the phase before was the first version and after some tests this version was created. The naming of the folders was more like a summary of the files it contained. The Lib folder contained the files with the classes that were extended by basically all the other files or very important files for the system, like the config-file, base controller and model and a database-file. The routes were also described in a file in this folder.</p>

<h2>Version 0.3:</h2>
<span class="bold">Framework:</span> SexyFramework<br />
<ul>
	<li>Switched to new folder structure
		<p>The previous version had a folder structure that was just made, not thought thru. In this version the folders are rearranged to a better structure where the names still show what is in the folder. The folders containing the controllers, models and views are now in the application folder, which made it more clear and easier to work with. Lib was renamed to core, because that is what it is. It wasn't a folder with libraries anymore. There are also two subfolders in core, namely modules and helpers. A module is a class which can be extended, like an admin-part of the website. A helper is a class that helps you with for instance translation or creating HTML.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Removed ORM
		<p>The ORM class is removed. The name wasnâ€™t right for the class and it was pretty hard to write a good ORM, so the decision was made to get rid of it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Created base_view from view-stuff from the base_controller
	<p><span class="italic">Because controllers and models had their base file, the views wanted one too.</span> To keep methods and variables organised, the base controller was cleaned of the view methods. These were combined into the base view.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Model ??? now loaded in base model instead of base controller</li>
	<li>templates renamed to template</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.4:</h2>
<span class="bold">Framework:</span> SexyFramework<br />
<ul>
	<li>Validation Helper built</li>
	<li>Load Module</li>
	<li>router class and router combined to router module</li>
	<li>dbase removed</li>
	<li>removed default template (Global var)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.5:</h2>
<span class="bold">Framework:</span> SexyFramework<br />
<ul>
	<li>routes now only in config/routes.json</li>
	<li>load and router module replaced with a core class</li>
	<li>admin and image modules created</li>
	<li>base_controller tries to load a model that corresponds with the loaded controller</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.6:</h2>
<span class="bold">Framework:</span> SexyFramework<br />
<ul>
	<li>created text and date helper</li>
	<li>Applied Singleton design pattern to database</li>
	<li>completed plural helper with almost all rules</li>
</ul>
